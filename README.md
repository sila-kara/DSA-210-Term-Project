# DSA210-Term-Project: "Analysis of the Impact of Education Level, Demographic Factors, and Inflation on Wage Trends (2000-2022)"
This project was prepared by SÄ±la Kara as a term project for the DSA 210 course in Sabanci University in the 2025 Spring semester. This project analyzes the effects of education level and demographic factors on wage disparities, as well as the influence of inflation on real wage growth from 2000 to 2022.

In this project these three hypotheses will be tested:
- **[First Hypothesis](#1-impact-of-education-level-on-wage-trends):** Individuals with higher education levels experience greater real wage growth compared to those with lower education levels.
- **[Second Hypothesis](#2-impact-of-demographic-factors-on-wages):** Wage disparities based on gender and ethnicity are significant, with women and ethnic minorities (Black, Hispanic) earning systematically lower wages compared to men and the majority group (White).
- **[Third Hypothesis](#3-impact-of-inflation-on-real-wage-growth):** Rising inflation negatively affects real wage growth, reducing purchasing power over years.
