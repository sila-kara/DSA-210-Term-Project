# DSA210-Term-Project: "Analysis of the Impact of Education Level, Demographic Factors, and Inflation on Wage Trends (2000-2022)"
This project was prepared by Sıla Kara as a term project for the DSA 210 course at Sabancı University in the 2025 Spring semester. It examines the impact of education level and demographic factors on wage disparities, as well as compares how individuals with different education levels have been affected by inflation over the years from 2000 to 2022.

In this project these three hypotheses will be tested:
- **[First Hypothesis](#1-impact-of-education-level-on-wage-trends):** Individuals with higher education levels experience greater real wage growth compared to those with lower education levels.
- **[Second Hypothesis](#2-impact-of-demographic-factors-on-wages):** Wage inequality based on gender and ethnicity are significant, with women and ethnic minorities (Black, Hispanic) earning systematically lower wages compared to men and the majority group (White).
- **[Third Hypothesis](#3-impact-of-inflation-on-wage-growth-across-education-and-demographic-groups):** Inflation negatively impacts real wage growth, with lower-educated individuals experiencing greater losses in purchasing power over years.

## **Motivation**
As a university student, I have always been interested in the relationship between education, socioeconomic factors, and financial stability. Understanding how wages vary based on education level, gender, and ethnicity, and how inflation further affects these disparities, is not only important for academic research but also crucial for gaining a better understanding of the dynamics of professional life as a future employee. Through this analysis, I will have the opportunity to apply what I have learned in class and gain hands-on experience in data analysis, while also developing a deeper understanding of the socioeconomic factors underlying wage inequality.

## **Project Goal**
This project aims to shed light on the underlying factors of wage inequality over the years and examine the impact of inflation on this disparity. In this context, comparisons will be made regarding the wages of individuals from different groups over the years by considering factors such as education level, gender, and ethnicity, and the hypotheses mentioned above will be tested. As a conclusion of this project it is aimed to identify long-term wage inequality trends and examine how education, demographics, and inflation impact economic mobility. The findings may help better understand income disparities and support future policies to reduce wage gaps.
